# remove-background-using-reference

this is a quick test to remove the background of an image by using a reference image with no subject, replaces it with black

i.e, take a photo with camera on a tripod, move the subject and take another photo of just the background.

Only works if the background and camera doesn't move and lighting doesn't change. Only tested with a black felt background
